# bird-rpki-config

I pretty much followed this guide: https://brooks.sh/2019/11/11/validating-bgp-routes-with-rpki-in-bird/

Install bird:
`sudo yum install -y bird2`
or
`sudo apt install -y bird2`

Edit the bird.conf file to your settings

Add in the bird.conf config to /etc/bird.conf 

Start bird and configure it to start at boot
`sudo systemctl start bird.service`
`sudo systemctl enable bird.service`

Command to show all invalids for IPv4 and IPv6:
`show route primary table master4 where roa_check(roa_v4, net, bgp_path.last_nonaggregated) = ROA_INVALID`
`show route primary table master6 where roa_check(roa_v6, net, bgp_path.last_nonaggregated) = ROA_INVALID`

Command to reload config after changing bird.conf:
configure soft

Command to show connection to connection to RPKI validator:
show protocols rpki1

You can execute commands like this in the shell to get the list of invalids:
`/usr/sbin/birdc 'show route primary table master4 where roa_check(roa_v4, net, bgp_path.last_nonaggregated) = ROA_INVALID' | sed -e '1,2d' | awk {'print $NF,$1'}`
